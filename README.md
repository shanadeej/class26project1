Red Velvet Cake Recipe

INGREDIENTS
½ cup (102 grams) shortening (or butter, margarine, or any type of fat used for baking and making pastries)
1 ½ cups (300 grams) sugar
3 eggs
2 tablespoons cocoa
1 ½ ounces red food coloring
1 teaspoon salt
2 ½ cups (315 grams) flour
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup (240 ml) buttermilk
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon vinegar

Frosting
16 ounces cream cheese, softened
2 cups (400 grams) powdered sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 stick butter (approx 110 grams)

MAKING THE CAKE
1
Gather and measure out all of the ingredients. Good bakers know that moving quickly and efficiently in the kitchen leads to better cakes and smaller messes. Measuring out ahead of time makes it possible.
2
Cream shortening and gradually add in sugar. Use an electric mixer set to medium speed. Add the sugar along the edges and slowly work it in to avoid sugar splatter.
3Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each egg is added. Mix in well, keeping your beater moving. It is okay if you add them both at once, too.
4
Make a paste out of the cocoa and food coloring, then add to cream. In a separate bowl, use a whisk to blend the food coloring into the cocoa.
Fun Fact: The original red velvet cakes got their color because imported cocoa was actually red tinted. The food coloring came later.
5
Add salt, flour, baking soda, vanilla, and buttermilk, beating well after each ingredient is added. You can also mix the flour, salt, and baking soda in a separate bowl, adding at once. You can also add it all together into the batter one at a time, using the electric mixer to get a nice consistent batter.
Add the flour slowly to avoid splatter. It can help to add it with the buttermilk.

Pour vinegar over the batter. Just a splash is all you need -- it will give it a nice subtle tanginess.
7
Stir until well mixed. You want a thin, consistent batter with not chunks of flour or dry ingredients left. Want a little more red color? Add a few more drops of red food coloring.
8
Pour the cake in a large cake pan or 2 layer cake pans and bake in a 350ºF. The cake should take roughly an hour to cook. When it is done, you'll know through the toothpick test -- stab the center of the cake with a knife or skewer-- if it comes out without still-wet batter on it, it's done.

MAKING THE FROSTING
1
Set the butter and cream cheese on the counter to warm to room temperature. You'll be whipping the butter and cream cheese up, but that only works if it is soft enough to whip! Set the two dairy products out for 15-30 minutes to get soft.
In a pinch, you can gently microwave them to speed things up, but keep it very brief. You don't want liquid.
2
Combine butter and cream cheese. An electric mixer is best, as it will make quick work of the dairies, but a wooden spoon and whisk work well too. They don't have to be perfectly combined, just well mixed.
3
Add powdered sugar slowly, keeping the mixing going throughout. Powdered sugar will want to poof and fly out as you mix it. To avoid a mess, add it in 3-4 parts, mixing almost all of the first part in before adding the second.
4
Add vanilla and whip until creamy. Keep the mixer (or your mixing hand) going until the frosting is nice smooth texture. If you want to thin it out a bit so it spreads better, add 2 tablespoons of cold milk.
5
Cut the cake into layers and frost. Place a little pat of icing on the bottom of our plate or cake dish to keep the bottom layer from sliding around.[10] Then frost it and stack another layer on top, frosting the top of that. Don't worry too much about the sides yet.
Do not try to frost the cake while it is still hot. Let it cool completely.
6
Assemble the layers and continue frosting. Stack the layers up high, frosting between each layer with a 1/4" of frosting or so, adding more to taste.
7
Frost the cake and enjoy! For bakery quality frosting, keep the knife clean after every pass, using a little warm water to ensure your frosting knife applies the icing smoothly and evenly. Use big globs of icing at a time and don't try to spread it too thin. By working in small areas, not spreading too thin, and cleaning the knife regularly, you can get a quality frosted cake.
If you've got time, real pros will "double frost." Start with a thin layer of frosting everywhere -- it is okay if it pulls up crumbs. Then freeze the cake for 15 minutes, pull it out, and frost "for real." You'll be astonished how easily it goes on!
